Utility
=======

I have made these utility classes and projects during my time at university


Makefile
-----------

	Drop the makefile into any of the project subfolders and make. Change target variable to the desired executable name.

	Change the directories to where ever you want to store the source, object files and executable
	
	Example:
		SRCDIR   = ./    ##directory for the cc and header files
		OBJDIR   = ./	 ##directory for the .o files
		BINDIR   = ./	 ##directory for the executable
