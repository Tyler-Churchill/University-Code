=======

These utility classes I have made during my time at university


Makefile
-----------

	Change target to your desired executable name

	change directories to where ever you want to store your source, object files and your executable (output)
	
	Example:
		SRCDIR   = /src     ##stores your cc and header files
		OBJDIR   = /obj	    ##stores your programs .o files
		BINDIR   = /bin	    ##stores your programs executable
