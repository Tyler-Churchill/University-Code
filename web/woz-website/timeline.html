						<h1>Pranksters</h1>
						<h2>1971</h2>
						<img src="img/1.jpg" class="img-responsive" id="date-img" alt="Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak">
						<p id="content">	Steve Wozniak was always fond of pranks. Woz had created a small device that emitted TV signals. When activated, the device would make the TV in the room go
							fuzzy, prompting his friends to hit the TV to fix it. When someone hit the TV he would deactivate the device and the picture would return. This eventually led to his friends holding the TV's antenna to prevent it from going fuzzy.
							 He also hung "Bring Your Pet to School Day" posters around his school which ended up with dogs and cats chasing eachother. 
							Steve Wozniak was introduced to Steve Jobs by Bill Fernandez. Fernandez saw that Jobs and Wozniak shared an interest in computer technology and pranks. Woz and Jobs began sharing ideas and started to play with creating new tech. The two created a BlueBox, a piece of hardware which exploited the telecommunication network at the time to allow free long distance calling. Jobs and Steve would use this box to famously call the Vatican City imitating as Henry Kissinger in hopes of talking with the Pope. </p>

						<h1>The Beast</h1>
						<h2>1976</h2>
						<img src="img/2.jpg" class="img-responsive" id="date-img" alt="Woz's prototype">
						<p>In 1975, Woz tested his first home computer prototype. This was the first time in history that text displayed
						on a television was generated by a computer that was small enough and cheap enough to exist in the home. Woz was 
						driven to create this technological advancement to impress a small computer club named the Homebrew Computer Club. The club contained hobbyists that shared an interest in computers. The club members would go on to create the microcomputer industry we have today.

						Woz kept improving on this design. He solely develop the circuit board, operating system, and hardware. Jobs saw the possibilities of this design and set out to convince Woz to sell it as a fully assembled product.
						They together raised money by selling their possessions and started assembling the first Apple I computer boards in Job's bedroom. 
					
						With this product in hand, Jobs and Woz formed the Apple Computer Co. on April 1, 1976 (later renamed to Apple Inc.). They sold the Apple I
						for $666.66.</p>

						<h1>New Vision</h1>
						<h2>1977</h2>
						<img src="img/3.jpg" class="img-responsive" id="date-img" alt="Apple II">
						<p>After the small success with the Apple I, the duo began to work on the Apple II which debuted in 1977. The Apple II is regarded as the world's first personal computer, as it shipped with a keyboard, mouse, monitor, and storage options in one small compact product. The still newly founded Apple
							company saw $2 million in sales by the end of 1977. For the Apple II, Woz had found a way to produce colored pixels for the computer using low cost parts. Other big companies needed equipment worth thousands of dollars to produce the same effect but Woz's solution used only a single $1 chip. Woz has stated that "putting color in the computer was probably one of the biggest
							things Apple ever did" in an interview with FORA.tv. Woz and Randy Wigginton also added a flexible disk drive that replaced the cassette-tape storage the Apple I used. The Apple II positioned itself in the market as
							a computer not just for "nerds" and hobbyists, but a computer for the working class individual.

						<h2>1981</h2>
						<img src="img/4.jpg" class="img-responsive" id="date-img" alt="Crash Report">
						<p>On February 7, 1981, Woz was piloting a small aircraft which soon crashed after takeoff. He sustained severe head
						injuries which lead to amnesia. He had no memory of the crash or memory of what he did after he was released from hospital. He later stated that Apple II computer games helped him regain his memory. Woz used his time in recovery as a reason to leave Apple.</p>

						<h1>Wheels of Zeus</h1>
						<h2>1985+</h2>
						<img src="img/5.jpg" class="img-responsive" id="date-img" alt="Woz">
						<p>Woz briefly returned to Apple after the plane accident, then left for good in 1985. He still maintains active shares in Apple but has elected to work on new projects. He founded Wheels of Zeus (WOZ) in 2002, a company which specialized 
						in GPS locator tags. The company dissolved in 2006 and ZonTrak acquired some of the company's assets and patents. ZonTrak seems to be inactive since. Woz has now turned to more philanthropic ventures. He donated his time teaching elementary level classes and encouraged hands-on learning and creativity. He has donated hundreds of computers to schools, and has also created many networks and servers for schools. Woz has obtained countless awards and honorary degrees for his contributions to the computer industry </p>
