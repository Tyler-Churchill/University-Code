Coding Styles : We will follow the following coding styles throughout the project

Variable names: All variable names will have a lowercase first letter and all other letters will be lower case except for any letters that start words, we will not be using “_” in variable names
eg :
varOne
varTwo
charOne
charTwo

Member function names will follow the same standards as above
eg:
getName
setName
callFunction

Class names will have capitals to start but will be named similarly to variable names 
eg:
BigBox
Game
ClassOne

Globals: Global variables will be stored as such
GLOBAL_VARIABLE
ITEM
KEY_ONE

Any loops will be noted as such, expect when the loop requires no brackets (executes one line of code)
for (int x = ?, ???,???)
{
SOME CODE
}

White space: White space will be kept to a minimum between functions i.e.
func()
{
CODE
}
//ONE SPACE OF WHITE
functTwo()
{
CODE
}


Parameters and any listings/ arithmetic will be done with one space between everything
This:
(i + 1 + 2 + 3)
as opposed to
(i+1+2+3)

File  Inclusion : Files will be included with stl items appearing first and local imports appearing below.

Comments: All comments will appear as follows:

/// \brief
/// detailed description
/// \param
/// \param
function f ();
