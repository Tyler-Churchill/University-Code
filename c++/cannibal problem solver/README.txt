ABOUT

This program creates a state space then traverses it with breadth first search to find the goal node. It relies on a vector move set to find test which move is possible

THIS PROGRAM DOES NOT WORK, THERE IS SOMETHING HAPPENING WITH WHAT I AM GUESSING TO BE
MY POINTER USAGE
I am guessing my solution is logically there, just not syntax wise. I have had to hand this in without it working as I have ran out of time.


TO RUN THE PROGRAM:

type "make" to build the program
run the .exe named "cannibal"


OUTPUT

The program will display the steps used to reach the goal


NOTE IF THIS PROGRAM DOES NOT RUN, MAKE SURE TO CHECK THE C++ CCFLAGS IN THE MAKEFILE
